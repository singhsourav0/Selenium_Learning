Word processors do not need to be complicated/paid yet every company and school uses word as default.

They want it to be simpler and it&#39;s the companies with clearly laid out training and certification that are winning. No tech wants to learn something for months and not get any cert or recognition - and they also probably like cloud for domestic reasons of not having to go to people&#39;s houses to fix things. I notice with the Gartner Charts as soon as a company is out of the leader quadrant it has the worst training program available - no video training - all in house either reading 600 page clunky manual&#39;s with no flow or you have to pay $6k+ a week to sit a course with them....or you hope some nice person has put together a playlist tutorial on youtube that is easy to follow.

The difficulty I can see is just team based work, or collaboration, particularly as a freelancer. Things like Notion or Google docs etc use the tools clients or other team members already use or are familiar with, same with slack and zoom etc. It&#39;s super annoying, and I&#39;d love to employ free or cheap open source alternatives where I can. It&#39;s just difficult in some cases. Maybe I&#39;ll find some workaround as time goes on and the open source tools get better (and the mainstream closed sources become more expensive and less secure and riddles with AI), maybe then others will be more receptive to use what I use (i.e the open source stuff). Great video though, and awesome rec&#39;s. üôå"

Software that&#39;s downloadable I believe can do this, but you shouldn&#39;t expect anything extra for software that no one is being paid to update or maintain. You can&#39;t just have people spending time that they&#39;ll never get back to update software, fix bugs, and add features that you want for free indefinitely. That, in my opinion is extremely entitled and unrealistic."

If it is bring value to your existing product I don&#39;t see why not to pay a monthly fee for it. For example, Freelance web developers that build websites for businesses, may use Scheduling Software like Calendly to allow their client&#39;s customers to book appointments because they can&#39;t be asked to set up open source software as it requires a bit of configuration. This is probably true for Freelance web developers that aren&#39;t really coders and use out of the box tools like Wix, Hostinger and maybe WordPress.<br><br>I definitely agree that some companies (Adobe being a big one) are taking the mick with the prices of some of their products. Adobe CC is a complete rip off and I stopped using photoshop and illustrator and now use Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo instead where I just had to pay a one time fee.<br><br>But if the price is fair and you have the budget for it, I don&#39;t see why you shouldn&#39;t use a SAAS as it may save you some time and let you finish a project for a client faster."

You&#39;re paying for a) the people that keep it running, and that is people developing, people maintaining, people supporting it and b) depending on the software, the interop with the &quot;larger ecosystem&quot;. If b is unavoidable, you&#39;re stuck. a is the touchy one, because it&#39;s a balance of scales. It makes sense to DIY IF the cost of subs is considerably larger than the &quot;man hour&quot; cost of DIY OR you can&#39;t really afford the service.<br>It all comes down to the old &quot;nobody wants a power drill, everyone wants holes drilled&quot;.

I mean an actual proper desktop application and not some churned out little bit more than a webapp!<br><br>I WAS a user of Windows Mail since the Vista days. This morphed into or was a purposefully enshittified web app that really had many &quot;bolts&quot; lose at last. It was enough at that time and did what I wanted it to do. Then followed a short stint of what I thought at that time was a proper application - full Outlook! That was an even messier thing that also was somehow kind of stuck in the 15 years ago past.<br><br>Next I fell into the &quot;marketing trap&quot; of Thunderbird. A somewhat poorly translated into German thing and some annoying little things in using it I would have somewhat accepted but then MS somewhat changed the login to my Outlook email account. I was about cursing at this issue for about one year and only recently &quot;figured out&quot; what actual 2 different settings I need in order it properly working. It turned out my issues were based on an incomplete migration from Mozilla of my email settings and the &quot;funny&quot; guys at Mozilla basically were silent about this. Just look at all the open issues on there &quot;support&quot; forum that have not one reaction from any Mozilla devs and just linger unresolved for many years or decades now.<br><br>The really sad part is that I even can&#39;t shove some ‚Ç¨ 200 into someone&#39;s pocket to get an email client I want unless I code such a thing myself!

All those subscriptions are worth it to a business since it&#39;s very cheap and allows you to iterate much faster: you also get official support, something most open-source projects don&#39;t offer (like, I have to ask to pay to get help from a maintainer, it isn&#39;t included in a nice, predictable expense). Sure, you might not like subscriptions, but a business does since it&#39;s predictable. Also, as for self-hosting all these tools: almost never do you need to export data, almost never is your hosting more reliable than the company&#39;s. In sociology there&#39;s this way of looking at things like you would do in UNIX: one thing that does one thing only and does it well. By this I mean that I don&#39;t want to do everything, I&#39;d rather pay to have someone else only work on that, just like they also pay to have a cloud provider that does that, just like they also don&#39;t build the hardware but have someone do it for them. Everyone does their little part well, and they all get tied together."

I know many applications I would love to use and would help out a ton day to day, but at the same time, the cost of that software is just way out of this world for something that we as the IT have to deal with or support first before reaching out to these vendors for help. Many times these vendors do know how to fix the issue, but have to go this long support ticket train weck to get back to working condition and not a simple: hey we see issue A please fix. While I do agree with should pay for software, I also agree that these companies sometimes over charge for their software and if someone looking for a feature, will go out of their way to find something else instead or to crack it. Its sad to me these companies can figure out a system that works for a wider range of users. Even if that means not offering support even if you do pay for a smaller license fee. Most of the comments are a bit lost as well. You should pay for software. There are many reasons to, and sadly, its just part of enjoying the software that you use everyday. It does cost money to offer support, servers, paying good wages, and just having the captioal to ease customer needs."

Companies want a reliable software that has a constant support which unfortunately open source don&#39;t provide. They rather pay for WinRar  than using free software like 7zip, cause for Winrar there is a dedicated team and if any issue they can contact them and correct it. <br><br>And let&#39;s not forget about security, an X company provides a tool so usually it is expected to have the best security standards  (even though they don&#39;t). And if there is any breach they can simply correct it and update the system. <br>The same thing cannot be said about the open source, there is no benchmark that says it is safe and has best security practices.

They should be putting their effirt into proving out their business and building the product, not spending significant time and energy on the supporting stack.

Needs vary and if you&#39;re happy self-hosting and self-managing an open source solution, all the power to you!<br>However, if you&#39;re big enough to pay for Salesforce, then your needs probably also require serious scaling, customization and support. All of that costs money on top of the infrastructure. Is it really more economical to maintain a team of people just to keep your tools alive?<br><br>Even when I was a small business owner, we went for Microsoft 365 SMB. Could I host and manage my own email server? Probably. Do I want to spend my time on that? Absolutely not. It&#39;s easy to portray SaaS as a greedy money grab, but there&#39;s usually an added value aspect that&#39;s not easy to appreciate unless you try to go intependent and on-prem.<br><br>It&#39;s also a little misleading to act like all of these are simple drop-in replacements. Sure, you can swap Adobe CC for a bunch of different apps, but you lose a great deal of consistency. I don&#39;t even use Adobe&#39;s online services, but I still find it useful how seamlessly I can move between InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop.

Maybe a little more, factoring in benefits, insurance and everything else that comes with running a business. Office costs $8/month each. That&#39;s 0.1% of what I pay them for them to do their job productively. Furthermore, my customers use office. They expect things to be in .DOCX or .XLSX or whatever. So while I resent it a little bit, it still makes more business sense than using Libre Office. On top of that, the Office license allows them to install it on their personal computer at home. I find it frustrating that my $100k/year programmer won&#39;t ask for a $200 tool that he needs to do his job. Like, a 1% increase in productivity is worth $1000. I&#39;m a cheapskate, but I&#39;m also good at math."
